# RTL-design-of-FFT
This project implements FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) architecture in Verilog. The design includes butterfly units stages, fixed-point data handling, and verified testbenches for functional correctness. The RTL is fully synthesizable and suitable for FPGA. Simulation results validate the FFT operation for 2-point, 4-point, and 8-point FFT..
